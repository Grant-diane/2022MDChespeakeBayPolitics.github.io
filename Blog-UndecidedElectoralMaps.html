                    <p>The current Maryland Congressional voting maps have been highly debated
                        recently. Following the census in 2020, a routine redistricting took place,
                         with a specific aim by many Maryland Politicians to remove
                        Gerrymandering altogether. This is a very difficult feat, especially
                        for a state like Maryland which has been carefully gerrymandered for
                        decades. As a state, Maryland has eight congressional districts. Every year all
                        of these districts, but one vote in a Democrat, which makes sense as Maryland
                        is famously a very Democratic state. However, there is always a district
                        that is Republican for two reasons. One, because naturally there are higher
                        populations of Republicans in certain parts of the state, and two, because
                        the districts have been split to place Republican populations in a singular
                        district as much as possible. Currently, Maryland has a high population of
                        Republican voters in the western mountainous region and the eastern shore
                        region. For example in one of the proposed solutions to the current
                        electoral maps, the district that encompassed much of Western Maryland made
                        sure that it included Frederick, a city in western central Maryland that has
                        more of a liberal population. This goes both ways and it is difficult to
                        tell what the best and most equally representative approach is when creating
                        this district. It is a very important note to mention though because when
                        redistricting this second potentially Republican district can go one of two
                        ways impacting the representation balance in the U.S. House of
                        Representatives.

                        Now as mentioned, gerrymandering has historically been a problem in
                        Maryland. After a mere cursory glance at Maryland's former third electoral
                        district (for full disclosure the third is my home district) the odd shape
                        will take anyone aback. Jokingly called the 'praying mantis district' the
                        shape seems illogical and the City of Baltimore in this iteration of the
                        congressional district map is split amongst at least three separate
                        districts.

                        The current controversy is not with Maryland's new congressional , which
                        are much cleaner than previous versions, but with the Maryland legislative
                        maps. A nonprofit group called Fair Maps Maryland opposes the map as they
                        claim some of the districts are not compact or contiguous enough. The group
                        filed a lawsuit opposing these new maps. The lawsuit was a small part of a
                        much larger and controversial scramble by Maryland politicians to create and
                        approve legislative and congressional district maps in time. Back in
                        December, a special session was held in Maryland to approve legislative
                        maps, around the time Hogan vetoed the drawn maps. After much back and
                        forth, debates, drawing and redrawing, as well as more lawsuits, the
                        Maryland General Assembly signed off on legislative districting maps in
                        April 2022, a time that is arguably much too close to election season. The
                        final iteration was prompted after Judge Battaglia found the maps to be in
                        violation of Maryland's constitution as the districts were not respectful of
                        natural and political boundaries. The final map has left many Maryland
                        Republicans unsatisfied however there are some slight improvements to their
                        previous electoral prospects.
