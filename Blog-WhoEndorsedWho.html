                        The Sierra Club is one of the leading national interest groups focused on
                        advocating for policies benefiting the environment. Founded in 1982 as a
                        natural preservation group, the club expanded over decades, opening an
                        office in D.C. in 1963 to further promote its political aims and lobbying
                        efforts. The Sierra Club has chapters in each state, including 10 regional
                        chapters in Maryland alone. The endorsement of the Sierra Club is very
                        important as an indicator to voters as to which candidates are going to
                        advocate for environmentally responsible policy solutions.
                    </p>

                        The endorsement of the Sierra Club has made waves in the 2022 Comptroller
                        race. The current incumbent is running for governor (Peter Franchot), and in
                        his absence, Barry Glassman(R) and Timothy Adams(D) have put their hats into
                        the ring. However, it is Brooke Lierman(D), a former member of the Maryland
                        House of Delegates who nabbed the coveted endorsement. The Sierra club noted
                        her efforts to reduce single-use plastic and wasteful materials in the state
                        of Maryland. Lierman has also made a point to outline ways in which the
                        comptroller's office will be cognisant under her administration of the
                        environment. For example, she advocates for the creation of Maryland's first
                        Climate Resilience Officer to advise specifically on practices that will
                        evaluate environmental risk while also assessing overall financial risks
                        that the environment poses. Uniquely she also emphasizes the importance of
                        offshore wind development, something that has been debated much in Maryland.
                        Despite having funds allocated there is not as much growth as desired in
                        offshore wind farming partially due to the concern among residents of the
                        Eastern Shore about the obstruction of the ocean view. Lierman is
                        currently leading the comptroller race, indicating the potential for a
                        promising green future from the Comptrollers office.

                        Over in Montgomery County, there is a race for the county executive
                        position. The race is mainly between incumbent Marc Erlich and newcomer
                        businessman David Blair. The Sierra Club made a more controversial move in
                        this race, choosing to endorse Blair based on some of his proposed policies.
                        For example, Blair hopes to massively expand the reach of Solar Power in
                        Montgomery County schools, parks, and other areas as well as promote the
                        creation of zero energy buildings. Blair also hopes to restore tree canopy,
                        increase transportation options for bikers, and establish easier ways to
                        create electric vehicle charging stations. The huge controversy, however, is
                        that Blair is seen by many locals as not the best candidate when it comes to
                        the environment because Erlich has a strong record of making green choices
                        for Montgomery County, such as opposing a large highway project and shutting
                        down a trash incinerator. Some residents have even pointed out that the
                        Blair Family Foundation donated to the Sierra Club. While the donation was
                        small it has led some citizens to question the Sierra Club's choice of
                        endorsement even more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point in the Campaign season, the Sierra Club has released the
                        majority of its endorsements in Maryland which are all available on its
                        website <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/maryland/2022-election-endorsements">here</a>. While the endorsement for governor is not yet released, the
                        Attorney General endorsement is Anthony Brown and all the endorsements for State Senate and
                        House of Delegate Seats are announced.
