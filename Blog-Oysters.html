                    <p>In 2020, 841,751 pounds of Eastern Oysters were harvested in Maryland. Ever
                        since Europeans documented original oyster populations in the 1600s, oysters have been
                        a major part of mid-Atlantic cuisine. During the industrial revolution,
                        oyster harvesting ramped up alongside all other industries. Maryland fisherman started
                        practicing dredging, pulling weighted nets along the base of the bay, just before the
                        establishment of commercial oyster canning companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now around this time, a fascinating footnote in history arises, the
                        so-called 'Oyster Wars'. The battle between Maryland and Virginia watermen
                        arose due to regulatory differences. In the 1830s Maryland made dredging
                        illegal despite Virginia allowing the technique. The Maryland legislature
                        went further in the mid-1800s requiring a permit for harvesting oysters
                        which fueled the outrage among watermen on the disparity of opportunities.
                        The 'war' may seem trivial and generally economic but things escalated
                        significantly. Nearly half of the world's oysters were coming from the
                        region at the time making the trade profitable and thus enforcing all these
                        restrictions Maryland and Virginia passed was very difficult. Maryland even
                        created the Maryland Oyster Police Force (Virginia has a fisheries police
                        force as well) to enforce harvesting guidelines, while Virginia's Governor
                        William Cameron personally led an effort to thwart illegal dredgers in
                        response to the stubbornness of armed dredgers in the bay.

                    <p>
                        Jumping forward in the mid-1900s, oyster populations declined in the
                        Chesapeake due to new and emerging diseases, leading to the identification
                        of oyster 'dead zones' in the bay in the late 1900s. These 'dead zones' are
                        severely concerning as oysters serve not only an economic purpose but a deep
                        environmental purpose. The principal role of the Eastern Oyster in the
                        Chesapeake Bay ecosystem is to be a natural filter, removing nitrogen,
                        algae, and other excess nutrients. Much of the pollution of the bay can be
                        fixed through the reintroduction of healthy oyster populations.

                        Naturally, many groups have arisen to tackle this issue in Maryland. Both
                        the Chesapeake Bay Program and Chesapeake Bay Foundation work on oyster
                        restoration efforts. In addition to these established groups, the Oyster
                        Recovery Partnership (ORP), founded in 1994, is a group focused on the
                        specific needs of oysters. Oyster reef creation is one effort led by the
                        organization that involves recycling oyster shells and placing them back in
                        the bay. The ORP is also heavily involved in the push for aquaculture, a
                        growing industry in Maryland that some gubernatorial candidates have
                        endorsed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oyster recovery efforts have been very successful even if slow-moving. This
                        past year it was announced that the Tred Avon River has almost had its
                        oyster population fully restored
                        (https://www.cbf.org/news-media/newsroom/2021/maryland/cbf-adds-14-million-oysters-to-chesapeake-bay-in-maryland-in-2020.html).
                        Additionally, research in oysters has only been growing as the 2020
                        Chesapeake Oyster Science Symposium sponsored by the CBF showcased the work
                        of multiple researchers seeking to learn more about this all important
                        bivalve. The combined efforts of the watershed's watermen, restaurants,
                        interest groups, and citizens has led to the restoration of oyster
                        populations. Estimates show that this positive change will lead to reduction
                        in sediment in the bay, and eventually will help restore the ecosystem and
                        eliminate nay 'dead zones'.
