                    <p>Maryland has only had two Republican Governors in recent history,
                        which is notable since Maryland is famously a very blue state. In 2014,
                        Larry
                        Hogan ran against Anthony Brown in the Maryland Governors Race. In the
                        primaries
                        the Democratic frontrunner was clearly Brown who was Lieutenant Governor of
                        Maryland from 2007 to 2015 under former governor Martin O'Malley. Notably,
                        Doug Gansler, another longstanding actor in the Maryland political scene,
                        serving as Attorney General of Montgomery County and later for the state in
                        2006 and beyond. Gansler is running in the 2022 Gubernatorial election as
                        well. Anthony Brown was highly qualified not only serving as lieutenant
                        governor for so long, but as a lawyer and colonel in the U.S. Army reserves.
                        Brown was the favorite in the race and many preliminary polls predicted
                        that he would win easily against the Republican candidate. From all
                        outsiders
                        It seemed like the Maryland Governors Race was a sure bet for the democratic
                        party. What they weren't betting on was the brilliant campaigning from the
                        Republicans.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hogan was much less established. Despite being the son of U.S.
                        representative,
                        Lawrence Hogan Sr. of maryland's fifth district, Hogan found only mild
                        political success. Outside his time as State Secretary of Appointments,
                        his experience largely comprised of losing in the
                        Maryland 5th Congressional District race yet pulling much more of the vote
                        than he should have with his experience and funding as measured up to his
                        opponent.
                        The frontrunner of the
                        <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-governor-poll-20140607-story.html?page=1">
                            Republican primary</a>
                        was less clear, with Hogan polling just under 30% while his opponents David
                        Craig and Charles Lollar were both polling a little over 10% in May-June
                        of 2014.
