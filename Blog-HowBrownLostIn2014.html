                    <p>Maryland has only had two Republican Governors in recent history, which is
                        notable since Maryland is famously a very blue state. In 2014, Larry Hogan
                        ran against Anthony Brown in the Maryland Governors Race. In the primaries,
                        the Democratic frontrunner was clearly Brown who was Lieutenant Governor of
                        Maryland from 2007 to 2015 under former governor Martin O'Malley. Notably,
                        Doug Gansler, another longstanding actor in the Maryland political scene,
                        served as Attorney General of Montgomery County and later for the state in
                        2006 and beyond. Gansler is running in the 2022 Gubernatorial election as
                        well. Anthony Brown was highly qualified not only as lieutenant governor for
                        so long but as a lawyer and colonel in the U.S. Army reserves. Brown was the
                        favorite in the race and many preliminary polls predicted that he would win
                        easily against the Republican candidate. To outsiders, it seemed like the
                        Maryland Governors Race was a sure bet for the democratic party. What they
                        weren't taking into account was the brilliant campaigning from the
                        Republicans.

                        Hogan was much less established. Despite being the son of U.S.
                        representative, Lawrence Hogan Sr. of Maryland's fifth district, Hogan found
                        only mild political success. Outside his time as State Secretary of
                        Appointments, his experience largely comprised of losing in the Maryland 5th
                        Congressional District race yet pulling much more of the vote than he should
                        have with his experience and funding as measured up to his opponent. The
                        frontrunner of the <a
                            href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-governor-poll-20140607-story.html?page=1">
                        Republican primary</a> was less clear, with Hogan polling
                        just under 30% while his opponents David Craig and Charles Lollar were both
                        polling a little over 10% in May-June of 2014. Hogan formed much of his
                        campaign around limiting taxes and kept neutral on many social issues. Hogan
                        made sure to emphasize Brown's unkempt previous promises to not add any new
                        taxes. Another key point Hogan repeatedly mentioned in the campaign was the
                        existence of a rain tax in Maryland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Rain Tax was established in Maryland as a part of the Watershed
                        Protection and Restoration Act which was passed to support reaching the
                        federal guidelines for Chesapeake Bay clean up. The tax was intended to fund
                        stormwater management which would in turn reduce runoff pollutants in the
                        Bay. Only ten jurisdictions in Maryland implemented the rain tax, and each
                        jurisdiction chose how exactly they would charge for it. The tax was
                        relatively minimal only costing the average Baltimore County resident a
                        little under forty dollars annually. Despite the low tax amount, it didn't
                        stop some counties from opposing or protesting the tax in their own way. For
                        example, Fredrick County famously enacted a tax of only one cent annually
                        and even allowed for those in financial need to seek exemption from the tax.
                        Hogan centered much of his campaign around the promise of ridding the state
                        of the tax he framed as ridiculous and thus coined the term 'rain tax' which
                        is now commonly used. After all the idea of taxing the rain at its most
                        benign seems frivolous, while at its most sinister, dystopian. In framing
                        the tax this way, Hogan was able to make the Democratic party seem
                        overbearing and unreasonable. Between his common-sense messaging and his
                        neutral and liberal social stance as compared to the Republican party at
                        large, Hogan found great success in his campaign.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hogan won in 2014 with 51% of the vote. After taking office, Hogan did make
                        the taxes optional starting in 2015. In 2018 Hogan won his re-election
                        campaign against Ben Jealous. Having maxed out his term limits, Hogan will
                        leave the governorship, and a new governor will be elected in 2022 to begin
                        serving in the early winter of 2023.
