                <div class="w3-container">
                    <p>Since humans have inhabited the region, the Chesapeake Bay has played an
                        important role in human development. The livelihoods of generations have
                        relied on the region to support industries such as fishing, shipbuilding,
                        agriculture, and tourism. The industrial revolution brought much more
                        development and urbanization to the region, especially as Baltimore boomed
                        becoming a major shipping port and trade hub. With industrialization came
                        chronic overfishing that led to severely depleted oyster, shad, and herring
                        populations. Overfishing, industrial growth, and the overall impact of human
                        use of the Bay began to take their toll causing severe pollution levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Noticing this in the context of the larger environmental movement,
                        researchers began paying attention to the decline of the Chesapeake Bay
                        ecosystem in the 1970s. Before academics took note, Maryland locals started
                        noticing negative trends as population and business grew and wanted to get
                        ahead of future problems due to continual development. The largest
                        Chesapeake Bay interest group, The Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF), was
                        founded around 1967 by involved citizens of Baltimore and the Eastern Shore.
                        During its early years, the CBF launched several educational programs and
                        worked with a Congressman to advocate for the EPA to conduct a seven-long
                        year study of the Bay which laid much of the groundwork for the work that is
                        done today. The full study of that proposal can be found <a
                            href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/documents/Chesapeake_Bay_Program_Study_of_an_Estuary.pdf">here</a>.
                        The Chesapeake Bay Agreement of 1983 was a recognition of the need to
                        organize efforts across government boundaries to address pollution in the
                        Bay. The same year of its passing, the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) was
                        established with similar goals to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p> Since their founding, the CBP and CBF have both been involved in a number of
                        highly successful agreements and policy pushes. Most recently the <a
                                href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/what/what_guides_us/watershed_agreement">Chesapeake
                            Watershed Agreement</a> was updated in 2020 with the help of the CBP. In
                        the past year the, CBF continued its efforts across the board, focusing on a
                        court battle over the 2019 Affordable Clean Energy Rule, working with
                        agricultural sectors to implement better regulation, and steadily continuing
                        oyster restoration. There are countless local organizations all partnered
                        with a common goal of protecting the natural resource of the bay. The CBP
                        has developed a mapping tool that allows users to discover local groups near
                        them involved with the issues (https://www.chesapeakebay.net/action/join).

                        Each of these groups contributes to a vast political network of actors
                        working on behalf of the bay, its ecosystem, and all those who depend on it.
                        One of the biggest roles of these organizations outside of educational
                        outreach is advocacy and lobbying. One example of an upcoming bill in the
                        Maryland House that further addresses bay issues is H.R.3540, the Chesapeake
                        bay Science, Education, and Ecosystem Enhancement Act of 2021, otherwise
                        known as SEEE. The act mainly seeks to reestablish the National Oceanic and
                        Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA), Chesapeake Bay Office along with a
                        handful of other actions including the creation of grants and programs to
                        benefit Bay research and health. The bill has not made much headway right
                        now only being introduced in May 2021 and recently in February being
                        <a href="https://sarbanes.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/sarbanes-chesapeake-bay-restoration-legislation-passes-committee">approved</a>
                        by the House Natural Resources Committee. The SEEE Act is, however, a great
                        example of an upcoming piece of
                        legislation that will likely receive support from one or more interest
                        groups as the legislation moves through the pipeline. These interest groups
                        are significant when attempting to pass legislation, generate funding, and
                        publish research that aids in the long-term improvement of Chesapeake Bay
                        health.
